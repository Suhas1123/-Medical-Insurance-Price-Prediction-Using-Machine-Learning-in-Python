# 🩺 Medical Insurance Price  Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
Designed and implemented a **machine learning model** to predict **medical insurance costs**, leveraging **regression techniques**, **feature engineering**, and **evaluation metrics**.  
The goal of this project is to estimate insurance charges based on user attributes like age, BMI, smoking status, region, and number of dependents.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Built multiple **regression models** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performed **data preprocessing** (encoding, scaling, outlier handling)
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** for insight generation
- Implemented **feature engineering** to improve model accuracy
- Evaluated performance using **R²**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Imported the medical insurance dataset  
2. **EDA:** Analyzed data distributions and feature relationships  
3. **Preprocessing:** Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features  
4. **Model Building:** Trained multiple regression models  
5. **Evaluation:** Compared model metrics and selected the best performer  
6. **Prediction:** Predicted insurance charges for new data points  

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved strong predictive accuracy using regression-based models  
- Identified **smoking status**, **age**, and **BMI** as major cost predictors  

---

## 🧩 Future Enhancements
- Apply **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)
- Integrate **deep learning models** for better accuracy
- Deploy a **Streamlit** or **Flask** web app for real-time prediction
